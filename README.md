# CNN_Classification_Model
A beginning project based on ethnicity classification on American - German and African - Indian facial data

This is my first Deep Learning project based on image classification for a very different problem which I contemplated would be the best to start with.
The CNN model trained for German & American face dataset named "AMGER.h5", achieved 85% accuracy even though the dataset was less than 500 images per label yet it still needs maybe a thousand more proper images to be as close to be called as an excellent model.

While, on the African & Indian model "INDAF.h5", obtained 89% accuracy but this model needed a very stable and straight images as an input for correct prediction as compared to AMGER. The lack of data cost me the accuracy.  

The images are stored in the "data.zip" with a separate folder for each. Feel free to expand the dataset (I really need someone to give me the  DAAAATTTTAAAASSSSEEEEEEETTTTTTT...) 
Also I'm open for any suggestions or advice you'd like to give me.

NOTE: THESE MODELS ARE STILL ON THE BABY STAGE.
